## Part 1

The dataset that was chosen for the Midterm project was the Australian Institute of Sport Data set. The quantative response was chosen, which in this dataset is Body Fat (Bfat). Body fat was chosen for the current study, but the qualitative factor response could also be an interesting investigation like finding what body measurements correlate to different sports for example. The Body Fat response is important, because it is difficult and expensive to measure body fat directly. Finding easy measurements that predict body fat is critical where body fat cannot be measured directly. The method developed in this analysis could be used by athletic trainers to predict an athletes body fat based on easily measured quantities.



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
